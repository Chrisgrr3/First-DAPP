# First-DAPP

This repository will be used to keep track of notes and code samples while creating/learning how to create my first decentralized application through Truffle IDE.

1. We'll first want to create a directory for our DAPP. 

2. Now, we cd into that directory and run the command 'truffle init'
*If running into any errors related to running scripts, you'll need to enable script running for the system*

3. Once truffle has been initialized, the folders 'contracts', 'migrations', and 'test' will be added to the directory, along with a file 'truffle-config.js'.

4. Within the contracts folder, create a sample smart contract.

5. Once the smart contract is ready, head back to the root directory of the project and run the 'truffle compile' command.
